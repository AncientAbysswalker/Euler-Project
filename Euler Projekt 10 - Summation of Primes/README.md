# Summation of Primes

## Problem Statement

The sum of the primes below 10 is 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 17. Find the sum of all the primes below two million.

## Solution
Boring. I guess I brute forced this with my formal definitions of isPrime() and genPrimes() from past questions. Played with a lambda function for summation instead of a loop.
