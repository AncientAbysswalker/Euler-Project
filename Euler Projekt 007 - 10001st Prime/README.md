# 10001st Prime

## Problem Statement
By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is 13. What is the 10 001st prime number?

## Solution
I already have a function to determine if a number is prime given existing primes below it, and I have shown I know how to generate new primes by crawling forward along the natural numbers. The natural progression obviously would be to loop this for 10001 primes no?

NO

I cheated and downloaded the first 10000 primes in text format from a webpage to test very basic web crawling to text. Lol :P
