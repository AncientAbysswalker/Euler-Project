## Problem Statement

Work out the first ten digits of the sum of the following one-hundred 50-digit numbers.

<See Webpage for Numbers>

## Solution
Made a simple HTML crawler to grab the numbers off the webpage. I just brute-force added them in python because there is no size limit on integers. I understand how to go about doing this in C for example where we would use two or more integers to store the information and overflow into the next container as required.
