# Highly divisible triangular number

## Problem Statement

The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the 7th triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28. The first ten terms would be:

1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:

1: 1

3: 1,3

6: 1,2,3,6

10: 1,2,5,10

15: 1,3,5,15

21: 1,3,7,21

28: 1,2,4,7,14,28

We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors. What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?


## Solution
Made a simple brute-force script to crawl forward on the triangular numbers and then check how many factors they have. The number of factors can be simplified to a count of double the count in the rounded-up range of the square root of the number itself. See lines 20-22
