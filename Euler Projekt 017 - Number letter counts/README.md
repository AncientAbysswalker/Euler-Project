# Number letter counts

## Problem Statement

If the numbers 1 to 5 are written out in words: one, two, three, four, five, then there are 3 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 19 letters used in total. If all the numbers from 1 to 1000 (one thousand) inclusive were written out in words, how many letters would be used? 


## Solution
I wrote a function that should make names for numbers up to the quadrillions, though I am unsure as to how correct it is as even the numbers given in this problem do not strictly adhere to the standard they have listed...
